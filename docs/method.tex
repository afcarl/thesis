\section{Calibration for binary variables}

Consider a binary probabilistic prediction problem, where for each instance $i$ there is a true value $y_i \in {0, 1}$. A machine learning model for this problem assigns a probability $q_i$ for each instance, $q_i \in [0, 1]$. $q_i$ represents the degree of belief that the event $y_i = 1$ will happen.
